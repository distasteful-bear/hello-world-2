Hello, this is nothing yet, but hopefully it will become something soon
I am a student currently wrapping up highschool, and just locked into going to OSU next semester. 
I am hoping to become fluent (is that correct?) in python over the summer so I can have some basic
coding experience walking into university. Potentially as a side income/carreer in the future.
